# COVID19 Research Paper Analysis
Natural Language Processing and Unsupervised Hierarchical Clustering

---

# Background
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the White House and a coalition of leading research groups have prepared a dataset of open sourced research papers. This dataset is a resource of over 400,000 scholarly articles, including over 150,000 with full text, about COVID-19. This freely available dataset is provided to the global research community to apply recent advances in natural language processing and other AI techniques to generate new insights in support of the ongoing fight against this infectious disease. There is a growing urgency for these approaches because of the rapid acceleration in new coronavirus literature, making it difficult for the medical research community to keep up and extract insights from this growing body work.

The underlying goal of this project is to gain insights from this dataset to better inform how our healthcare system, governments, industries can tackle this growing problem by using NLP and other machine learning algorithms.

# Summary
The research question of the project is "Investigate the the difference of precaution measures used to prevent the spread of coronavirus between Pre-COVID19 and Post COVID-19 times".

The project is devided into 4 different parts:
1. Text cleaning and separation
2. Data Visualization and Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Model selection and fitting to data
4. Insights from the Analysis
